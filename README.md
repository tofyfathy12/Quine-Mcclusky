 A program that prints all possible but minimized SOP expressions of a function by only giving it the mintermsand the don't-cares if they exist.

Please let me know if there are issues which I'm not aware of.

DOWNLOADING THE PROGRAM:
if you want to download the program and use it with the gui just download the .7z file and extract the files on a folder on your pc.
